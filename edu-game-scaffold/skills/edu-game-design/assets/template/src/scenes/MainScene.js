// MainScene.js
//
// This is where the core mechanic lives. Per the design scaffold, this
// prototype should demonstrate ONE mechanic — but played across several
// rounds/instances with real variation between them, not just once.
// A player who plays through once should have seen enough variation to
// have actually learned something, not just watched a single fixed demo.
//
// Structure content as a data pool (e.g. a `scenarios` array below or in
// a separate src/scenarios.js) and have the game select/cycle through it
// at runtime — no API calls needed while playing, so this stays safe to
// publish as a static site with nothing sensitive embedded in it.
//
// Concept this game is about: {{CONCEPT}}
// (Fill in / replace this comment with the specific learning objective
// and mechanic-concept relationship agreed on in Phase 1/2 of the
// scaffold, so it's documented alongside the code.)
